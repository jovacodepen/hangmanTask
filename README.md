## RULES OF THE GAME 

1. You're goal is to guess what the random hidden word is by inputting characters into the input and clicking 'submit guess' or pressing the "enter' key on the keyboard 

2. You can only guess one letter at a time. If you guess a letter that isn't in the random hidden word, the hangman's noose is built on additional step 

3. You have a maximum of 10 guesses. If you haven't guessed the word by then, you lose. You can reset the game by clicking the 'reset game' button that will show.
